% COMMENTARY FOR OVERLEAF USERS
%
% You can freely edit and adjust all files ending with .tex directly in Overleaf.
% 
% HOWEVER: For full reproducibility and to follow the recommended workflow of the
% Overleaf - R - GitHub integration, please make changes to all other files 
% (including .bib bibliography files, figures, tables, and any generated content)
% using code and processes outside of Overleaf (e.g., in RStudio or your local editor).
% 
% This ensures that all data, results, and references remain version-controlled,
% reproducible, and in sync with your analysis pipeline.
